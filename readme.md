<h4>About</h4>
<p>
	This map displays an area that I would like to visit some day. I have added markers to locations that have some history/tourist interest.
</p>
<h4>How to Use</h4>
<p>
	Click on any of the markers on the map or any of the items in the "Locations" list
	to open a box on the map containing some headlines from the New York Times and some 
	images from Flickr about the location.
</p>
<p>
	You can also use the search box to narrow down the markers/list, based on the text
	you enter into the box.
